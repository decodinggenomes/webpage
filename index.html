    <h2>About the book</h2>

    <p><b>Decoding Genomes</b> demonstrates how to uncover information
      about past evolutionary and population dynamic processes based
      on genomic samples. The last decades have seen considerable
      theoretical and methodological advances in this area. These
      enable the assessment of critical scientific questions such as
      the impact of environmental changes on biodiversity and the
      evolution of pathogens during recent epidemics. The book gives
      the reader a detailed understanding of the whole process: from
      genome sampling to obtaining biological insights by applying
      sophisticated statistical and computational analyses. In
      particular, sequencing of genomic samples, the alignment of
      sequences, molecular evolution models, phylogenetics, and
      phylodynamics are core topics. Statistical and computational
      approaches discussed include dynamic programming, maximum
      likelihood, Bayesian statistics, and model selection, to name a
      few. The concepts introduced and applied throughout the book
      enable readers to answer questions across biological scales,
      including microevolution, macroevolution, immunology,
      development, cancer, and epidemiology, as well as in fields
      other than biology where evolutionary concepts are key, such as
      linguistics.</p>

    <h2>Target audience</h2>

    <p>The book is for students and researchers
      who aim to analyse genomic sequence data or develop statistical and
      computational approaches for such analyses. The content is tailored to
      readers from a wide variety of backgrounds, ranging from mathematics
      and statistics, computer science, or physics to biology, and, more
      generally, the life sciences.</p>

    <h2> The authors </h2>
    <p>All authors are or have been part of the
      <a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo">Computational Evolution
        group at ETH Zürich</a>, which is widely recognised as one of
      the leading teams in developing evolutionary and population
      dynamic models for analysing genomic data. Their various
      backgrounds &mdash; including mathematics, computer science, physics,
      and biology &mdash; help make this work accessible to a broad
      audience.
